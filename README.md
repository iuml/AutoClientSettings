# In order to run the script, you need to have these dependencies installed:
- Colorama
- Requests

# Script not working?

- Make sure you ran the script as an administrator.
- If it still is not working, DM me on discord for support.

# How do I make it an exe?
The best way in my opinion is to use pyinstaller, which will also allow easier ways to run it as admin.

If you would like a prebuilt version of the exe, contact me on discord.
